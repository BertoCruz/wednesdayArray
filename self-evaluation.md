# SELF EVALUATION
## on Arrays
### Dani L-C

How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
**_RESPONSE: _** I feel very confident on the implementation of arrays in my toolbox. i'm curious, though, are does Javascript have to deal with the complexities of an array being static like in Java? I guess not if we can .shift() and .unshift(). Java has a difference between Arrays and Arraylist, where Arraylists are dynamic and can hold more than a fixed amount.

Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
no additional training required here. One thing I really was reminded and motivated in was doing my own research on methods and referencing MDN Web Docs. **VERY USEFUL SITE!!!** i will be implementing the use of this site throughout Mod0 and beyond. the learning never ends! _i know a lot and yet nothing at the same time!_

What questions do you have about Arrays?
Another question, in java we learned about Matrixes using Arrays, is that something we'll implement in javascript?
